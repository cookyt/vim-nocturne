#Nocturne.vim
A dark colorscheme for Vim.

Nocturne: where your code shines like the moon and your interface
fades into the night. This is the result of my search for the perfect 
colorscheme: I made my own!

This is my personal colorscheme, so colors may change as I see fit. That said,
most changes will be minor.

##Installation
I suggest that you use [vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to install 
Nocturne. All you have to do is put

    Bundle 'euclio/vim-nocturne'

in your .vimrc.
